When designing software I do my best to write the code to be as modular as possible.  Creating modular codes helps in many ways, reducing the total lines of code, gives more flexibility to create dedicated functions that specialize in one task, and it's easier for testing.  If you are able to keep your code modular and clean, when issues crop up it's easier to comparmentalize the code to find where the source of the error is coming from.

The biggest takeaway from working with computational graphics is how we managed the memory while we were rendering our scene.  Beginning to learn about managing the memory as we render or execute code will have a big impact on the quality of our software in the future.
